# Verilog HDL Projects Repository

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Verilog HDL design and testbench files** developed for various **digital logic, sequential circuits, and arithmetic modules**.  
Each folder represents an independent module or experiment with its own `README.md`, design file(s), testbench, and waveform outputs.
